# VueJS calculator

Simple calculator implementation in VueJS.

[https://pfrohner.github.io/vue-calculator/](https://pfrohner.github.io/vue-calculator/)

## Requirements
 - Node 8+
 - npm install

For E2E testing a headless chrome is also required.

## Available Scripts

### `npm run serve`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br><br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser. (port may be different if this one is being used already)

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test:unit`

Runs the unit tests.

### `npm run test:e2e`

Run E2E testing with testcafe. (needs Chrome installed)

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder, and deploys it to github.io.<br>
It correctly bundles in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

This project template was built with [Vue CLI 3](https://cli.vuejs.org/), which provides a simple way to start Vue projects with no build configuration needed.
